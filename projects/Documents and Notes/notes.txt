DAY-1
data carrys all information inside it and how we carry data and knowlede it depends on individual for extracting it

1. Structured  data-in tableu format

2. Unstructured data-which is not in row and column format i.r pdf, jpg, jpg. It carries information but not in formatted way. Database management sysatem i.e MongoDB is used.

3. Semi-structured data- data with combination of structured and unstructured data. i.e Email,cc,bcc

AI-ML-DL(Artificial intelligence-Machine learning-Deep learning)

AI- More of concept which give more theory and logic
ML- Implementation of ML average data and averege computation
DL- COMPLEX CONCEPT ARE HANDEL WITH hevy data, high volume things

Natural Language Processing(NLP)- google translator. It happen with computer vision and NLP.

Variables is named to memory space.i.e First name, Last name, Gender, DOB, Email, Mobile, Location, SNN.
is a symbolic name refer to an object.

Strongly type language- int
Weakly type language- python language value is not able to verify as variable. Python is based on interpreter.
adapting neural method in machine brain we use deep learning


DAY-2
Python data type:
1. Standard Data Type:
-Number
 a.Int
b.Float
c.Complex
-Boolean
-String
Data Structure Data Type: Storage
1.List
2.Tuple
3.Set
4.Dictionary

(imagenory number)-i
There re only 3 key word (True, False and None) which start with upper case
Anything inside 'a' or "b" is string

-List is mutable i.e consodered to change.
-List is represented by square bracket[ ]
